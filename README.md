### Features

This package contains several traits definition for usage in any PHP development
project. The first published version contains very few useful traits but I will
of course feed the project with some more source code very soon ! :o)

#### Who needs this Code ?</h5>

Any PHP developer who want to save some time in defining utilities methods for
features as simple (but important) as Date Formatting, URL Friendly String
Formatting, cURL requests or Input Validation (More to come soon).

### Conclusion

Any help, bugfix pull request or discussion about this repository are welcome! This project
started as a hobbie development and mainly served its purpose when I needed to develop Android
Apps. This is the reason why I felt like sharing it might be helpful to other people !

I hope you'll enjoy!

Cheers,
Greg.
